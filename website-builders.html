                        It is safe to say that you can execute the most complex design idea using Wix. And for that, you
                        don't even have to be a skilled developer. <strong>Wix successfully combines both complete
                            design

                        But if you want premium add-ons, your own domain name, and no Wix ads, you should consider

                        But you're not limited to choosing a template and then editing it. There are several ways in
                        which you can build a website:
                        <br><br>

                        </ul>
                        First of all, you can use a classic way of creating a website. Simply choose a template yourself
                        and customize it with a drag and drop editor.
                        <br><br>
                        Wix has more than 500 professionally-designed templates. All of them are free for you to use,
                        even if you choose the free plan.

                        <p>
                            Generally, website builders can be used for any kind of website. From the smallest personal
                            blogging project to the huge enterprise site. You just simply need to <b>choose the right
                                platform</b>.
                            <br><br>
                            On the contrary, website builders were <b>designed with people with no coding knowledge</b>
                            in
                            mind.
                            They are meant to make building a website available to everyone.
                            <br><br>
                            So considering the salaries of web developers and monthly prices of site builders - the
                            latter
                            is way cheaper.
                            <br><br>
                            Similarly, website builders still limit the possibilities of websites, so they are <b>not

                            <br><br>
                            So we come again to the users without any coding knowledge - website builders will be best
                            for
                            personal websites, blogs, small business sites, small- to medium-sized eCommerce, and

                        <h3 id="step2">Step 2: Determine Your Budget for the Website</h3>
                        <p>
                            Most of our recommended website builders have free plans. However, the cheapest plans that
                            will
                            provide you with a domain name and an SSL certificate starts at $4.68/mo. To get more
                            features
                            like custom SEO tools, larger data allowances, eCommerce features, you may need to spend up
                            to
                            $30/mo.
                            <br><br>
                            So here are simple guidelines:
                            <ul>
                                <li><b>Around $5/mo</b> gets you a website builder service that fits small personal
                                    websites.</li>
                                <li><b>For around $10/mo</b> you can get a website builder plan that will work for
                                    small- to
                                    medium-sized business websites and informational sites.</li>
                                <li><b>Anything above $20/mo</b> will get you features that can power an eCommerce store
                                    and
                                    large business websites.</li>
                            </ul>
                            Consider that domain names are usually free for only 1 year so you may want to add around
                            $10 to
                            $15 for your second-year expenses
                        </p>
                        <h3 id="step3">Step 3: Evaluate Your Web Development Skills</h3>
                        <p>
                            The main purpose of all website builders is to give you the possibility to start a website
                            without any coding knowledge. This means you will be able to manage every website builder.
                            <br><br>
                            But some are more complex than others.
                            <ul>
                                <li><b>Drag-and-drop</b> website builders are usually the easiest to use. But they also
                                    allow
                                    you the most freedom. Consider if you'll be able to arrange everything orderly,
                                    choose a nice color scheme, and optimize this kind of site.</li>
                                <li><b>What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get (WYSIWYG)</b> builders are more fit for beginner
                                    users. You
                                    won't have such design freedom, though templates are curated so you can easily build
                                    a professional-looking website.</li>
                                <li><b>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</b> builders can save a lot of time for both
                                    beginner users
                                    and professionals. You'll simply need to answer several questions and the system
                                    will do the job for you. All you need to do - upload your content.</li>
                            </ul>
                            Advanced users may want to check if the builder allows tweaking HTML, CSS, or even
                            JavaScript for more design customization.
                        </p>
                        <h3 id="step4">Step 4: Think if You Need the Possibility to Switch Platforms</h3>
                        <p>
                            Most of the website building platforms <b>don't have the possibility to import or export the
                                website.</b>
                            <br><br>
                            Take Wix for example - if you decide to move, you'll need to start the whole building a
                            website process from scratch. More, you won't be able to change the theme once you chose
                            one.

                            <img src="./Images/web-builder/website-transfers.jpg" alt="">

                            Only a few website builders will let you export the website files. This list includes only
                            Sitejet and Weebly.
                            <br><br>
                            So think whether you're ready to stick to the platform or you'll want to move later.
                            Fortunately, with the majority of builders, you get free trials and can see whether you like
                            them or not
                        </p>
                        <h3 id="step5">Step 5: Check the Website Builder Performance</h3>
                        <p>
                            Often forgotten by newcomers, performance is the feature that can make or break a website.
                            <br><br>
                            Since July 2018 Google introduced its Speed Update. Google started using page speed as a
                            factor to rank mobile searches. And please don't say that "Oh, it's just mobile searches,
                            I'll be fine." Cause no, you won't. In the same 2018, mobile devices took more than 50% of
                            all website visits. And the percentage keeps growing.
                            <br><br>
                            Another fact for you:
                            <br><br>
                            According to Google research, the bounce rate increase with each passing second of page load
                            time for mobile users. So if your page loads in <b>1 to 3 seconds,</b> the <b> bounce rate
                                during that
                                time increases by around 32%.</b> And if your page takes somewhere around 10 seconds to
                            load -
                            here's your <b>123% increase in bounce rates.</b>
                        </p>
                        <h2>Best Website Builder FAQs</h2>
                        <p>We answered all the most common questions about website builders.</p>
                        <h3>How Much Does It Cost to Build a Website?</h3>
                        <p>
                            You can create a website starting with no budget and spending thousands - both ways are
                            possible. Website builder premium plans usually begin in the range of $10/month. For this,
                            you can expect to get a domain name for the first year but after that, you'll need to pay
                            around $10/year for a simple .com domain. So that sums up to around $130 for the second year
                            - if you choose one of the cheaper plans.
                            <br><br>
                            eCommerce and business websites will cost several times more - you can expect to pay over
                            $20/mo. And if you need a managed service, the price will go even higher.
                        </p>

                    <p>VPS hosting is a mysteriously sounding name to most website owners, and at first sight, it
                        doesn’t quite explain what you really get when you buy it.
                        <br><br>
                        So here’s everything you need to know about VPS hosting, plus 8 of the best VPS services in the
                        market right now:
                    </p>

                    <h4>But first, what is VPS hosting?</h4>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        VPS stands for Virtual Private Server:
                        <ul>
                            <li>“Private” means that you get all of the server resources allocated to you privately. You
                                don’t share these resources with other customers.</li>
                            <li>“Virtual” means that your server isn’t a separate machine but runs as a virtual set up
                                on a more powerful server. That “parent” server can have more virtual machines running.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <b>… And what are the benefits of VPS hosting?</b>
                        <br><br>
                        There are two main benefits of VPS hosting.
                        <br><br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The first one is that the VPS setup generally guarantees stability. The server resources
                                are assigned to you alone, which means that you’re immune to what any other users are
                                doing with their servers.</li>
                            <li>You get root access and full control of your server. You can choose the software you’re
                                going to install on the server, and then you can configure that software however you
                                wish (within reason). This lets you match your server configuration to your
                                application/website.</li>
                        </ul>
                        Overall, VPS hosting is a great solution for users who need dedicated server resources and
                        unlimited customizability.
                        <br><br>

                            This is a fully managed VPS that gives you daily backups and free website migrations (upon

                            Liquid Web offers its VPS hosting packages from $15 / month if you pay for two years up
                            front. Paying monthly is $59, which is a considerable increase. For that price, you get:

                                <li>Unlimited number of sites</li>

                            It’s worth pointing out that Liquid Web uses InterWorx as its hosting control panel.
                            Although functional, it’s a less popular solution and thus can increase your learning curve.
                            If you want to use something more familiar – like cPanel or Plesk – those are also
                            available, but come at an additional fee.
                            <br><br>
                            Hosting on Windows servers is also possible and starts from $54 / month when paid for two
                            years up front.
                            <br><br>
                            Liquid Web offers no refunds on their VPS plans.

                            Scala Hosting was established in 2007 – which is relatively recently by hosting industry
                            standards – with the goal of making VPS hosting accessible to anyone. These days, they offer
                            different types of hosting, but their VPS setups remain to be the flagship.
                            <br><br>
                            Scala gives you a 99.99% uptime guarantee. However, in practice, that number is a tad bit
                            lower according to our test setups. The loading times are satisfactory.

                            Scala runs its own hosting infrastructure with two data centers: one in the US (Dallas) and
                            one in Europe (Bulgaria).
                            <br><br>
                            The VPS hosting plans are scalable and let you configure your machine up to a really
                            granular level. For example, you can pick how many CPU cores, RAM, and SSD storage space you
                            need – independently of one another.
                            <br><br>
                            The setup is also fully managed, offers unlimited site migrations and Scala’s own SShield
                            Security protection system.
                            <br><br>
                            The support is available 24/7 via live chat. They also boast about their ticket response
                            times being in the range of 15 minutes on the average.
                            <br><br>
                            Scala’s servers run a custom management panel called SPanel. On the surface, it looks to be
                            just a skin over cPanel, so there’s no learning curve.

                            As mentioned, this VPS provider offers hosting in many different configurations, plus you
                            can tailor-build your server to fit your needs exactly. At entry-level, their VPS plans
                            start from $9.95 / month when paid for three years upfront ($12 when paid monthly). For that
                            price, you get:

                            The server specs are okay for the price and offer more flexibility than a shared server

                            HostGator offers its VPS options for hosting from $19.95 / month when paid for three years
                            upfront ($29.95 when paid monthly). For that price, you get:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Unlimited number of sites</li>

                            </ul>
                            There are two hidden costs, though. First, your server comes with no control panel. Having
                            cPanel installed is another $10 / month. Secondly, renewals are $79.95 / month.
                            <br><br>
                            There’s a 45-day money-back guarantee.

                            Bluehost has a nice selection of hosting options on offer and covers pretty much all sides
                            of the market – from cheap shared servers to fully-capable dedicated servers. Their VPS
                            offering sits somewhere in the middle, providing a good balance of features.
                            <br><br>
                            In terms of uptime, Bluehost VPS sits comfortably at 99.99%. The loading times are also good
                            at around 750 ms based on our data.

                            Bluehost uses its own server infrastructure/hosting environment, but they are not very clear
                            on their data center locations or how many of them there are.
                            <br><br>
                            Feature-wise, Bluehost offers everything that a modern VPS host should have, including root
                            access, modern technologies like OpenStack and KVM, guaranteed resources, and dynamic
                            resource allocation.
                            <br><br>
                            There are also other original features like instant provisioning and a great access control
                            module (you can give other people access to parts of your hosting account). Managing your
                            server is done via an enhanced control panel of Bluehost’s that’s built on top of cPanel. It
                            features special tools for VPS management and WHM control.
                            <br><br>
                            The support is available 24/7, and you will get the assistance and attention you need.

                            Bluehost VPS hosting plans start from $18.99 / month (on a three-year contract). Reducing
                            the length of the contract increases the price (monthly, it’s $29.99). For that price, you
                            get:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Unlimited number of sites</li>
                                <li>2 GB RAM</li>
                                <li>2 CPU cores</li>
                                <li>30 GB of SSD disk space</li>

                            </ul>
                            Bluehost also includes a couple of useful bonuses like a dedicated IP address, a free domain
                            name for the first year, and a free SSL certificate.
                            <br><br>
                            The renewal price is $29.99 / month. Bluehost offers a 30-day money-back guarantee.

                            What stands out about InMotion Hosting is all the different angles they take in the web
                            hosting industry. They not only offer hosting, but also have tailor-made offerings for
                            freelancers, agency owners, and resellers. Basically, no matter who you are and what you
                            want your hosting to do, InMotion Hosting will have something for you.
                            <br><br>
                            They offer two types of VPS hosting: managed and unmanaged. Here, we’re going to focus on
                            the managed setups since this is what most people are likely to choose.
                            <br><br>
                            As per our tests, the loading times are very good, at around 500 ms. The average uptime
                            could be a bit better, though – currently at 99.97%.

                            InMotion Hosting has two data centers of their own: one in Los Angeles and the other in
                            Washington, D.C.
                            <br><br>
                            InMotion Hosting certainly doesn’t disappoint when it comes to features. All accounts come
                            with a neat dashboard that shows you resource consumption; you get root access, scheduled
                            backups, and access to secure email accounts.
                            <br><br>
                            There’s also a free website migration transfer – upon request via support ticket. Above
                            that, every account gets two hours of dedicated time with a T3 system administrator as part
                            of InMotion’s Launch Assist™.

                            The customer support is available 24/7. The support agents are US-based, and you can contact
                            them via toll-free phone lines, email, and live chat.

                            A2 Hosting is another company on the list that tries to cater to different types of clients
                            and needs. You’ll find multiple types of hosting setups in their lineup (like WordPress
                            hosting or eCommerce), and many of them coming in different configurations as well.
                            <br><br>
                            The VPS selection alone offers three main types of setups: unmanaged, managed, and managed +
                            root access (called Core VPS).
                            <br><br>
                            The uptime is very good, at 99.99%, but the loading times are a bit underwhelming –
                            currently at around 1.2 s according to our data.

                            upgrades. Server security and backups are managed for you as well.

                            The customer support is available 24/7. A2 is very confident of their support quality,

                            Hostinger has data centers located in the US, Asia, and Europe (UK).
                            <br><br>
                            Feature-wise, Hostinger gives you all the basics of VPS hosting, but there are also some
                            extras that even more expensive hosts don’t offer. For once, you can pick your server
                            operating system (OS) – there’s CentOS, Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, and Suse.
                            <br><br>
                            Apart from that, you get full root access, a dedicated IP, there’s IPv6 support, and easy
                            web script installers.
                            <br><br>
                            There’s 24/7 support available via live chat, but keep in mind that this is an unmanaged VPS
                            setup. This means that the majority of server management tasks are on you, and the support
                            team won’t be able to help you solve a software-related issue due to the nature of it.

                            As mentioned above, Hostinger VPS starts from just $3.95 / month, which is the lowest price
                            on this list and possibly a great choice for a small business. That said, to get this
                            extra-low price, you have to commit to a four-year(!) contract (the longest on the list).
                            Paying monthly is $9.95, and the renewals are also $9.95 / month. For that price, you get:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Unlimited number of sites</li>
                                <li>1 GB RAM</li>
                                <li>1 vCPUs</li>
                                <li>20 GB SSD disk space</li>

                            </ul>
                            One additional cost that can be mandatory for many users is enabling daily backups – at
                            $1.89 / month. Also, if you require priority support, that is $1.99 / month (you’ll get
                            moved to the top of the queue).
                            <br><br>
                            There’s a 30-day money-back guarantee.

                            Liquid Web runs their own hosting infrastructure and has <b>five data centers</b> – two of
                            them in
                            the
                            US, and also <b>in London, Amsterdam, and Sydney</b>.
                            <br><br>
                            The VPS setups are ready to handle whatever you might throw at them in terms of traffic and
                            offer easy integration with Cloudflare CDN and Akamai. There’s also DDoS protection, a cloud
                            load balancer, server protection layers, and vulnerability assessment integrated.
                            <br><br>
                            This is a fully managed VPS that gives you daily backups and free website migrations (upon
                            request).
                            <br><br>
                            Last but not least, if you need assistance setting things up, the support is available 24/7.
                            That said, you might have to wait a while for the live chat to reply.

                            <br><br>
                            Liquid Web offers its VPS hosting packages from $15 / month if you pay for two years up
                            front. Paying monthly is $59, which is a considerable increase. For that price, you get:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Unlimited number of sites</li>
                                <li>2 GB RAM</li>
                                <li>2 vCPUs</li>
                                <li>40 GB of solid-state drives (SSD) disk space</li>
                                <li>10 TB of bandwidth</li>
                                <li>Runs Linux</li>
                            </ul>
                            It’s worth pointing out that Liquid Web uses InterWorx as its hosting control panel.
                            Although functional, it’s a less popular solution and thus can increase your learning curve.
                            If you want to use something more familiar – like cPanel or Plesk – those are also
                            available, but come at an additional fee.
                            <br><br>
                            Hosting on Windows servers is also possible and starts from $54 / month when paid for two
                            years up front.
                            <br><br>
                            Liquid Web offers no refunds on their VPS plans.

                    <p>
                        VPS hosting is often the next step up for people who are tired of their standard shared hosting
                        setups and want to get something that’s generally more reliable and powerful.
                        <br><br>
                        Luckily, quality VPS hosting providers don’t have to be super-expensive. Here’s a quick summary
